Analysis for Vertesy et al., "Gruffi removes stressed cells from brain organoid datasets".

## Abstract
Organoids enable disease modeling in complex and structured human tissue, in vitro. Like most 3D cultures, they lack sufficient oxygen supply, leading to cellular stress. These negative effects are particularly prominent in complex models, like brain organoids, where they can prevent proper lineage commitment. Here, we analyze brain organoid and fetal single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from published and new datasets totaling about 190,000 cells. We describe a unique stress signature found in all organoid samples, but not in fetal samples. We demonstrate that cell stress is limited to a defined organoid cell population, and present Gruffi, an algorithm that uses granular functional filtering to identify and remove stressed cells from any organoid scRNAseq dataset in an unbiased manner. Our data show that adverse effects of cell stress can be corrected by bioinformatic analysis, improving developmental trajectories and resemblance to fetal data.

## Scope
The aim of this repository is to provide an insight, and be a transparent about the analyses, as well as to help readers build similar pipelines.

Therefore, the scripts are provided as a resource, not as an executable pipeline. The authors apologize to the reader, but cannot provide support on troubleshooting if the reader tries to run (parts of) the pipeline on his or her own machine.

We will try to answer conceptual questions, for that please use the issues tab, rather than sending private emails.

Thank you for reading.
